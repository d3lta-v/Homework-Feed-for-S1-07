This folder has three files altogether, the README, which is this file, and the DashCode project alongside with the actual product. You are welcome to create a fork of this project, by changing the colors/gradients of the widget, editing the address or even making multiple UIs to display multiple blogs at once. If you wish to create a fork, please contact me at random.rrr3@gmail.com so that we can collaborate.
